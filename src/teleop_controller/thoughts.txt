Testing Code
    - Can NOT use SparkMax related functionalities without testing on REAL HARDWARE
    - Will push this code to teleop-sim branch and keep going with SparkMax functionality on teleop-hardware branch

- msg_Bool is the type of message I'm subscribing to 
- Do I "need" all of the code with params?
