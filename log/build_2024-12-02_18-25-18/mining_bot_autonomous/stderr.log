[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:14 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findtft.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "tft", but
  CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "tft" with any of
  the following names:

    tftConfig.cmake
    tft-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "tft" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set "tft_DIR"
  to a directory containing one of the above files.  If "tft" provides a
  separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been installed.
